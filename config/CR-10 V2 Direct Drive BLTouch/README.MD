The Creality CR-10 V2 ships with an older 1.1.6 version of Marlin. These config files are for Marlin 2.0.x

As with all config files, replace the stock Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h files in directory /Marlin with those found in this directory to build for the CR-10 V2 w/ Titan Direct Drive and BLTouch.
